## Project 3 notes

### What was most challenging in _designing_ your first responsive web project?
It wasn't very difficult. Social media and blog websites are very popular. It's 
normal to know what these sites look like when accessed from a phone. The most 
difficult part was accepting certain compositions that could be better if there
was only one type of canvas.


### What was most challenging in _coding_ your first responsive web project?

The plethora of options for layout. Every type of layout or obejct change has a different language
associated with it.



### What are you excited or interested to learn about next (as relates to web design or development)?

I want to learn the best way to showcase my artwork on a website.

## Best Practices

### HTML

- [ ] HTML is indented to enhance readability

- [ ] HTML is lowercase (valid exceptions: filenames)

- [ ] Double quotes are used around attributes (e.g., `href="https://mica.edu"`, `class="class-name"`)

- [ ] Markup makes use of semantic elements and avoids `div`-itis

- [ ] A proper HTML5 `doctype` is set

- [ ] The HTML head includes a proper `title`

- [ ] Heading tags are used semantically, not simply for presentation

- [ ] `img` elements have helpful `alt` text (or a blank `alt=""` for decorative elements)

- [ ] Markup content is not presented in ALLCAPS for presentational purposes; this is achieved via the `text-transform` CSS property instead

- [ ] HTML is error free



### CSS

- [ ] CSS is lowercase

- [ ] Declarations within each ruleset are ordered alphabetically by property name

- [ ] A semicolon ends each declaration

- [ ] Comments are used to break up sections and explain your code

- [ ] `box-sizing` is declared

- [ ] All floats are properly cleared

- [ ] Selectors are either bare elements or classnames (IDs are avoided)

- [ ] Classnames are helpful and written kebab-style (i.e., using hyphens)

- [ ] CSS does **not** reiterate browser defaults

- [ ] CSS is not written in such a way that it is immediately overwritten by other declarations

- [ ] Color values are used logically and consistently (e.g., hex and hsl values aren't mixed)

- [ ] Units are used logically and consistently

- [ ] Zero measurements do **not** include units

- [ ] Styles are written **mobile first**

- [ ] CSS is error free
