        <h2>"action-packed" - Risa Benedyk</h2>
        <h3>Rotten Tomatoes gives it 45%.</h3>
        <h4>Directed and produced by John Turteltaub!</h4>
        <h5>RATED PG-13</h5>
        <p>Nicolas Cage plays Benjamin Franklin Gates, a historian and amateur cryptologist searching for a
            lost treasure of precious metals, jewelry, artwork and other artifacts that was accumulated into a
            single massive stockpile by looters and warriors over many millennia starting in Ancient Egypt, later
            rediscovered by warriors who form themselves into the Knights Templar to protect the treasure,
            eventually hidden by American Freemasons during the American Revolutionary War. A coded map on the back
            of the Declaration of Independence points to the location of the "national treasure," but Gates is not
            alone in his quest. Whoever can steal the Declaration and decode it first will find the greatest treasure
            in history. </p>
