    <h1>
        <strong>Yes, the Octopus Is Smart as Heck. But Why?</strong>
    </h1>

    <h2>It has eight arms, three hearts — and a plan. Scientists aren’t sure how the cephalopods got to be so
        intelligent. By Carl Zimmer Nov. 30, 2018

    <p>
        To demonstrate how smart an octopus can be, Piero Amodio points to a YouTube video. It shows an octopus pulling
        two halves of a coconut shell together to hide inside. Later the animal stacks the shells together like nesting
        bowls — and carts them away.“It suggests the octopus is carrying these tools around because it has some
        understanding they
        may be useful in the future,” said Mr. Amodio, a graduate student studying animal intelligence at the
        University of
        Cambridge in Britain.</p>

    <p> But his amazement is mixed with puzzlement.
        For decades, researchers have studied how certain animals evolved to be intelligent, among them apes,
        elephants, dolphins and even some birds, such as crows and parrots.
        But all the scientific theories fail when it comes to cephalopods, a group that includes octopuses, squid and
        cuttlefish. Despite feats of creativity, they lack some hallmarks of intelligence seen in other species.

        “It’s an apparent paradox that’s been largely overlooked in the past,” said Mr. Amodio. He and five
        other experts on animal intelligence explore this paradox in a paper published this month in the journal Trends
        in Ecology and Evolution.

        For scientists who study animal behavior, intelligence is not about acing a calculus test or taking a
        car apart
        and putting it back together. Intelligence comprises sophisticated cognitive skills that help an animal thrive.
        That may include the ability to come up with solutions to the problem of finding food, for example, or a knack
        for planning for some challenge in the future. Intelligent animals don’t rely on fixed responses to survive —
        they can invent new behaviors on the fly.
        To measure animal intelligence, scientists observe creatures in the wild — watching a dolphin stick
        a sponge
        on its beak to avoid getting cuts from sharp rocks and coral, for example. Or they bring animals into the
        lab and offer them puzzles to solve, such as rewarding crows when they learn to rip paper into strips of
        just the right size.

        Only a few species stand out in these studies, and by comparing them, scientists have identified some shared
        factors. The animals have big brains relative to their body size, they live for a long time, and they can form
        long-lasting social bonds.</p>
