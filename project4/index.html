    <p>To be a green designer means to think about our environment and to practice sustainable design. This includes
        using
        non-toxic recyclable materials and saving on energy and resources where we can. The ultimate aim of practicing
        sustainable design, is to reduce waste, use as little resources as possible, and the resources that are used,
        should be
        unharmful to our environment and re-usable.As a graphic designer, your job is to produce creative ideas to
        promote your
        client’s message effectively. By promoting a greener image, you are adding value to your relationship with the
        client.
        Consider that consumers have never decided against a product because it is green, but they have and will decide
        not to
        buy it if it isn’t. In fact, 82% of consumers are focused on buying green products and services. Customers are
        becoming
        more drawn to going paperless, recycled products, bio-degradable products and low emission products.Companies
        that are
        supporting the eco-friendly movement are also seeing increasing numbers in their sales.</p>
